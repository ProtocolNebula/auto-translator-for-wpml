This folder contains all classes which interact with external functions to do a translation.

For example, you can use a "GoogleTranslation" API from GitHub, to make it compatible
with wpmlat you only need to make or edit the ```TranslationService``` including the
API file and changing functions.

After that, you can choose the TranslationService from ```Settings -> WPML Auto Translator``` in ```wp-admin``` dashboard.
